/**
 * <p>Longest Common Prefix.</p>
 *
 * <p>Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note: Longest common prefix for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.</p>
 *
 * <p>As an example, longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".</p>
 *
 * <p>Given the array of strings, you need to find the longest S which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b><br/>
 * Given the array as:<br/>
 * <code><pre>
 * [
 *   "abcdefgh",
 *   "aefghijk",
 *   "abcefgh"
 * ]
 * </pre></code></p>
